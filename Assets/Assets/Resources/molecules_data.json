    "description": "Birch Pollen Food Syndrome: Pollen Food Syndrome (PFS), also known as Oral Allergy Syndrome, occurs when the immune system reacts to proteins in certain foods that resemble pollen allergens, causing symptoms like itching and swelling in the mouth and throat. The birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 has a structure similar to antigens found in peaches, apples, celery, cherries, carrots, and kiwis. This structural similarity can cause cross-reactivity, leading to allergic reactions when consuming these foods."
